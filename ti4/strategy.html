<div class="clTopicText">
<p>Be objective focused</p>
<ul>
    <li>score atleast one public objective each round</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to score control objectives first because these are the most difficultto achieve</p>
<p>Try to score tech objectives last because these cannot be taken away from you</p>
<p>Save trade goods for spend objectives or emergencies (use justthe planets for build)</p>
<p>Prepare for stage II objectives in advance</p>
<p>Set up a big "swing round" (4 points in one round):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Timing Imperialrightis essentialforthis</li>
    <li>Secret objectives that can be scored during the action phase are important(there are only 5)</li>
    <li>Save powerful action cards forthis moment</li>
</ul>
<p>Anybody at 6 points is in striking distance</p>
<p>"Win from behind" is usually a safer strategy than "win from ahead", butit depends on the faction </p>
<ul>
    <li>An early big lead will paint a target on your back</li>
    <li>Don'trush to score easy secret objectives</li>
</ul>
<p>Rememberinitiative order when picking strategy cards if you suspectit will be the lastround</p>
<p>Never give up - even if you are 5 points behind, you can still "swing" a victory (agenda phase, transactions and a good hand of action cards can often make the difference)</p>
<p>Don't waste resources (command tk, fleets, cards) on an action ifit doesn't get you a point or prepare you for getting a point</p>
<p>Being aggressive for no reason will only turn the meta-game against you</p>
<p>If you completely ruin someone's chances to win you just made an enemy with no other goalthan to hunt you </p>
<p>Always be open fortrade and negotiations (really help others achieve their goals, you just have to be more efficient at achieving yours)</p>
<p>Play people against each other</p>
</div></div>

<div class="clTopic clGuideGeneral"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">Game start</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>Round 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t start with 2 carriers and 4 infantry, your first priority is to get those</li>
<li>If you don't have 2 starting tech,try to catch up</li>
<li>Expand and try to fill your slice</li>
</ul>
<p>Round 2 (standard):</p>
<ul>
<li>Consolidate your position</li>
<li>Prepare fleets, command tokens and action cards for a big round 3 (have objectives in mind)</li>

<div class="clTopic clGuideGeneral"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">Always</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>At the beginning of each action phase prepare:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set planets in groups according to their intended use: unit production, command tokens, technology, objectives</li>
<li>Prepare the plastic you intend to produce</li>
<li>Prepare the action cards you want to play</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a tech path in mind - prepare in advance the tech cards you intend to research</p>
<p>Know the promissory notes you got from other players and rememberto play them at the right time - also remember you can trade them</p>
<p>Know your opponents status</p>
<ul>
<li>What abilities and technology they have</li>
<li>How many command tokens (actions left)</li>
<li>Trade goods, action cards, promissory notes</li>
<li>What objectives are they trying to score next</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that retreat is an important option</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t forget the Announce Retreats step</li>
<li>Always retreatif you are going to lose</li>
<li>Avoid getting into big space combats without having where to retreat</li>
</ul>
<p>Use all your planets before you pass</p>
<p>When you build in your home system, instead of activating it, use the secondary of Warfare</p>
<p>With every build get at least 2 infantry units</p>
<p>Countthe sabotage cards left (there are 4)</p>
<p>Have a good Command Token (C.T.) economy</p>
<ul>
<li>CTs are the mostimportantresource in the game</li>
<li>CTs fuel your actions and abilities</li>
<li>CTs can be converted into anything via actions</li>
</ul>
<p>Save Riders for agendas that are “For or Against” (never play them on “Elect” agendas)</p>

<div class="clTopic clGuideGeneral"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">Ground forces mobility</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>Being able to quickly move yourinfantry where you need itis essential (attack or defense)</p>
<p>Extending yourrange:</p>
<ul>
<li>makes it harderfor opponents to defend their planets against all of your of potential attacks</li>
<li>gives you more flexibility</li>
<li>makes you less predictable</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 3 solutions for ground force mobility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gravity Drive with Dread2 and/or Carrier2 good for massive invasions or planet sniping</li>
<li>Cruiser II with Dacxive Animators and Infantry2 greatfor sniping planets butlargerinvasions are more difficultto accomplish</li>
<li>Space Dock II on the borders, expand from there</li>
</ul>
<p>With a yellow skip Transit Diodes is a great addition to any ofthese (especially for cruisers</p>
</div></div>

<div class="clTopic clGuideGeneral"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">Tech Paths</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>Optimaltech path should:</p>
<ul>
<li>have good synergy with yourfaction abilities</li>
<li>solve ground force mobility problem</li>
<li>have no "dead"tech (one that you never use)</li>
<li>be ready fortech objectives:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>"own 2 tech in 2 colors"(stage I)</li>
    <li>"own 2 unit upgrades"(stage I)</li>
    <li>"own 3 unit upgrades"(stage II)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>Otherthings to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>faction tech can be decisive for some factions</li>
<li>in a 10 point game you can research 5-7 techs</li>
<li>tech skips allow for better synergies and open more creative tech path options</li>
<li>Magen Defense Grid is almost never useful, it's usually betterto skip it</li>
<li>similarlyGraviton Laser System isn’t much use if you don’t anticipate utilizing a PDS network</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the "own 2 tech in 2 colors" objective there are 6 possible tech path starting points:</p>
<p>2 Blue + 2 Green = best synergy</p>
<ul><li>opens: Infantry II, Carrier II, Fighter II</li></ul>
<p>2 Blue + 2 Yellow= very good synergy</p>
<ul><li>opens: Dreadnought II, Carrier II, Space Dock II</li></ul>
<p>2 Red + 2 Yellow= good synergy (with a red skip)</p>
<ul><li>opens: PDS II, Space Dock II, Destroyer II, War Sun, Cruiser II</li></ul>
<p>2 Green + 2 Yellow= some synergy</p>
<ul><li>opens: Infantry II, Space Dock II, Cruiser II</li></ul>
<p>2 Red + 2 Blue = bad synergy</p>
<ul><li>opens: Carrier II, Destroyer II</li></ul>
<p>2 Red + 2 Green = worst synergy</p>
<ul><li>opens: Infantry II, Destroyer II, Cruiser II</li></ul>
</div></div>
 
<div class="clTopic clGuideGeneral"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">Action cards</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>You have two options for a steady flow of cards: either get Neural Motivator early or save more command tokens forthe secondary of Politics</p>
<p>Always know your action cards and remember to play them atthe righttime (Timing Window)</p>
<p>Play the junk action cards when you are closing on the seven cards hand size limit</p>
<p>Consider saving the good cards forthe lastrounds</p>
<p>Hold Public Disgrace untilthe lastround so you can block Imperialfor a potential winner</p>
<p>Sabotage is the most important action card</p>
<ul>
<li>it can block someone from winning the game</li>
<li>it can protect you when you take the last point</li>
</ul>
<p>Hold Sabotage for powerful cards like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public Disgrace (return picked strategy card)</li>
<li>Political Stability (keep the previous strategy c.)</li>
<li>Rise of the Messiah (+1 infantry on every planet)</li>
<li>Imperial Rider (gain aVictory Point)</li>
<li>Parley (return enemy units to space area)</li>
<li>Unexpected Action (remove your command t.)</li>
<li>Signal Jamming (place a player's command t.)</li>
<li>In the Silence of Space (move through ships)</li>
<li>Reactor Meltdown (destroy a space dock)</li>
<li>Spy (takes an action card from you)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 7 cards that have 4 copies in the deck: Sabotage, Direct Hit, Flank Speed , Skilled Retreat, Morale Boost, Shields Holding, Maneuvering Jets</p>
<ul><li>the other 52 are unique</li></ul>
<p>Certain action cards have precise keywords that tell you when or how the card should be played:</p>
<ul>
<li>cards with the keyword “When” are played before cards with the keyword “After” (agenda phase)</li>
<li>multiple effects separated by the keyword “then”: you must resolve all effects written on the card</li>
<li>multiple effects separated by the keyword “and”: you must resolve as many effects as possible (but not necessarily all ofthem)</li>
</ul>
</div></div>

<div class="clTopic clGuideGeneral"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">Strategy cards</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>Initiative is always important but in the last round it is often the decisive factor in winning the game</p>
<p>Warfare, Leadership, Technology</p>
<ul>
<li>are usually picked first(especially in early game)</li>
<li>if you get one try to stall it as much as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Trade</p>
<ul>
<li>before you take it, make sure you have neighbors and thatthey are willing to trade</li>
<li>never replenish for free</li>
</ul>
<p>Politics</p>
<ul>
<li>always consider taking it if you are picking last</li>
<li>consider selling the speaker token</li>
<li>make sure you have the first pick in the last round of the game -for this you need to take Politics the round before (players at 5-6 points)</li>
</ul>
<p>Construction</p>
<ul><li>play it on your firstturn so others can’t do the secondary without locking their systems</li></ul>
<p>Imperial</p>
<ul>
<li>always consider taking it if you have Mecatol</li>
<li>timing it right is essential for a "win from behind"</li>
</ul>
<p>Diplomacy</p>
<p>Never pick it in Round 1 because you give out to the others much more than you gain.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have a faction that start with only 1 carrier, you pick last, you have a 5 resource system next to your home system</li>
<li>Mentak - flip a green skip and get Cruiser II R1</li>
<li>Xxcha - flip a blue skip and get Gravity Drive R1</li>

<!-- UNITS -->
<div class="clTopic clGuideUnit"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">Infantry</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>The mostimportant unitin the game because infantry takes and defends planets</p>
<p>It’s easierto defend than to take planets, that’s why the attacker has to bring more infantry</p>
<p>To defend a planet you need at least one more unit than the sum of bombardment dice and infantry units the attacker can bring</p>
<p>You don’t need to own the space area of a system if you have enough infantry on the planets</p>
<p>Infantry II is the most important upgrade, always consider getting it</p>

</div></div>

<div class="clTopic clGuideUnit"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">Carrier</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>The mostimportant ship because ofit’s capacity</p>
<p>The other ships are there only to protect your carrier and it’s precious cargo: yourinfantry</p>
<p>The success of an invasion depends on how many infantry units you can carry</p>
<p>Always have at least 2 carriers on the board, (no carriers = missed opportunities)</p>
<p>When you switch focus from invading planets to space combat, carriers are also important because they carry the fighters: your armor</p>
<p>Carrier II is situational</p>
</div></div>

<div class="clTopic clGuideUnit"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">Cruiser</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>Good in-between unit, but usually you get it when you don’t have enough resources for a dreadnought</p>
<p>Cruiser II</p>
<ul>
<li>fastest ship in the game</li>
<li>great for unexpected attacks</li>
<li>great for sniping undefended planets</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
 
<div class="clTopic clGuideUnit"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">PDS</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>Their main purpose is to defend planets by blocking Bombardment</p>
<p>Firing before ground combat is also important</p>
<p>It’s usually better to put only one on a planet</p>
<ul>
<li>more planets protected from Bombardment</li>
<li>a wider defensive network</li>
<li>better odds against action cards and other game effects thattarget PDS units</li>
</ul>
<p>PDS II network with Graviton Laser System is an amazing combo, but only helps defensively</p>

</div></div>

<div class="clTopic clGuideUnit"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">Fighter</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>Their main purpose is to shield your fleets (the cheapest way to absorb hits)</p>
<p>Fighter II</p>
<ul>
<li>can be used offensively as a “swarm” by overwhelming the opponent</li>
<li>can be used defensively as a network oflone fighters that block opponent’s movement</li>
</ul>
</div></div>

<div class="clTopic clGuideUnit"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">Destroyer</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>Their main purpose is to shield your fleets against“assign to non-fighter ship” abilities</p>
<p>Can also be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>to block opponent’s movement</li>
<li>to quickly get neighbors fortransactions</li>
<li>for some objectives thatrequire space control</li>
<li>against fighters (limited without upgrade)</li>
</ul>
<p>The worst unit in the game - usually you get it to fill the production capacity or because you don’t have enough resources for a better ship</p>
<p>Main problem: the fleet supply itis much more important than the benefit a destroyer can bring</p>
<p>Destroyer II is only useful against fighter swarms</p>
</div></div>

<div class="clTopic clGuideUnit"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">Dreadnought</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>The best ship in the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>it has capacity</li>
<li>it has Bombard</li>
<li>it hits very well</li>
<li>it has reliable Sustain Damage (if upgraded)</li>
<li>the most upgradeable unitin the game</li>
<li>can be used offensively or defensively</li>
</ul>
<p>Dreadnought II is amazing and you get Gravity Drive and Sarween Tools as prerequisites ...</p>
</div></div>

<div class="clTopic clGuideUnit"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">Space Dock</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>Put it on high resource planets</p>
<p>Consider putting two space docks in a double planet system</p>
<p>Always have at least one fighter for protection against lone carriers</p>
<p>Always build at least 2 infantry units</p>
<p>Build as many units as production capacity allows (example: instead of building just 2 dreadnoughts, it’s better to get 1 cruiser, 2 infantry, 2 fighters and 1 dreadnought,for the same cost)</p>
<p>Space Dock II is only worth it if you go heavy on fighters (or sometimes infantry)</p>
</div></div>

<div class="clTopic clGuideUnit"><div class="clTopicName clShadowText">War sun</div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>Their main purpose is to "uproot" well defended planets by ignoring Planetary Shield and very good Bombardment</p>
<p>it’s betterto think ofthem as big carriers</p>
<ul><li>big capacity and always need an escort</li></ul>
<p>vulnerable to</p>
<ul>
<li>counter-attacks</li>
<li>Direct Hit action cards</li>
<li>assign to non-fighter ship abilities</li>
<li>pick target abilities</li>
</ul>
<p>It takes too long to gettech and gatherresources for a war sun, so it's only viable in a 14 point game</p>
<p>In a 10 point game only if you have two tech skips (red-red or yellow-red) and you have the resources to getthem quickly on the board</p>
<p>You are limited to only two war sun units, you can't have more</p>
<p>There is a secret objective thattargets war suns (when you build a war sun you put a point on the table, so be ready to defend it)</p>
